# rentacar

[GitHub](https://github.com/pdforest/rentacar)

This project is about a rent-a-car application that will be created using the object-oriented programming `(OOP)` paradigm due to the modeling of a real-life situation in which customers want to rent a car for a period of time and according to their needs.

Making a reservation involves modeling objects that fit perfectly into the paradigm with the ability to add properties, methods, and be reusable.

Also for several types of car objects, the same functionality could be implemented, i.e. polymorphism.

Users of the application should be able to choose between locations, dates, times and different types of features to rent a car that match it, make reservations and pay in advance. 

`Here are the user-stories:`

## Index

1. After a new load (or update) of the application, the user should see a form for a quick search based on the pickup and delivery of the location, the date from and to, the time from and to and also offer the possibility to enter a discount code to apply.

2. An option to view reservations should always be available by entering an email and a reservation code number.

3. The option to log in or register must also be available for member features, but membership is not conditional on renting a car. Please use personal email for user identification.

## Dashboard

1. After hitting the search button, the app should display the top car rental deals based on the search criteria, add a panel for additional filter options, and also the search panel for changing the search conditions.
